# Objective

## Purpose

This project exists to create an interactive, exploratory game that teaches and embodies the concept of gradient ascent—both in a mathematical sense and as a metaphor for human advancement, exploration, and discovery.

The aim is for players to:
- Engage intuitively with complex concepts like local maxima, exploration vs. exploitation, and emergent complexity.
- Experience metaphorical parallels to scientific, technological, and societal progress.
- Discover mechanics organically, without omniscient foreknowledge, mirroring real-world innovation.

## Core Goal

Enable people to explore the principles of gradient ascent in a playful, emergent environment that rewards curiosity, experimentation, and strategic thinking.

---

## Design Philosophy
- Metaphor-rich gameplay: Drawing parallels from history (Polynesian exploration, technological revolutions, scientific breakthroughs), natural processes (evolution), and algorithmic thinking.
- Emergent complexity: Simple, clear rules that allow surprising patterns and strategies to develop.
- Exploration over instruction: Encourage players to learn mechanics by playing, not by reading a manual.
- Scalable experience: Playable on a range of devices, with maps and mechanics that scale from ~100 to thousands of tiles.

## High-Level Concept

A tile-based exploration game where:
- The game board represents the boundary of human knowledge.
- Players push the perimeter outward (exploration) and mine existing tiles (exploitation).
- “Revolutions” or “Remixes” act as paradigm shifts that tectonically reshape the map, unlock new strategies, or alter fundamental rules.
- Information technologies—modeled as stages (Language, Writing, Printing Press, Internet)—change how discoveries spread and how players interact with the game world.

## MVP Objectives

The minimum viable product should:
1. Convey the gradient ascent metaphor in an immediately graspable way.
1. Support interactive tile exploration and movement.
1. Include simple rules for movement, vision, and mining.
1. Feature at least one “revolution” mechanic that changes the map.
1. Be accessible on desktop and mobile browsers using a well-supported framework (e.g., Phaser 3).

## Key Challenges
- Designing an iteration-friendly development process that supports prototyping and feedback.
- Balancing intuitive rules with sufficient depth for emergent strategies.
- Ensuring cross-device playability and scalability for large maps.
- Conveying complex rules through visual cues and game state, without overwhelming text.
- Structuring the game so AI-assisted development is straightforward (clear documentation, modular components, well-known frameworks).

---

## Why This Matters

Gradient ascent isn’t just a math term—it’s a lens for understanding:
- How humans explore the unknown.
- How innovations disrupt and reshape landscapes.
- How ecosystems (technological, societal, biological) evolve through iteration and feedback.

By embedding these ideas in a playable format, this project invites players to experience these dynamics rather than just read about them.

## Inspirations & References
- Games: Minesweeper, Minecraft, Civilization, Conway’s Game of Life.
- Frameworks: Phaser 3 (notably hexagonal grid implementations).
- Metaphors: Polynesian navigation, Northwest Passage exploration, technological revolutions, scientific paradigms.

## Collaboration Approach
- Use clear, documented APIs and frameworks with open-source examples to support contributor onboarding.
- Structure gameplay mechanics and assets for modularity—making it easy for contributors to add tiles, rules, or visual elements.
- Encourage AI-augmented development by maintaining code clarity, consistent naming, and minimal technical debt.
